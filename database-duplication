Database duplication is just how it sounds- two of everything in a huge storage system. There are several potential problems with this, including taking up double the storage space and information being difficuly and complicated to update. A first step in a solution to database duplication is to use artificial primary keys which avoids duplication between the master and any foreign keys. Another solution is to split the data into two tables, which allows the information to be stored in a single row in table and referenced by a foreign key from another table.
