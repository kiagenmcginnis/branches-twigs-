Do you love podcasts, music and women? Check, check and check? We've got you covered. Meet Gloria, a podcast curated and written by ladies about female-fronted bands and musicians. Join us once a month for exlusive interviews, live music performances and and relevant conversations about women in music. 

With your pledge of $10 to help get Gloria on the air, you'll receive a bonus episode featuring a totally rad local Seattle girl band. 

If you're so generous to donate any amount more than $20, you'll get to rep Gloria with a fresh t-shirt. Who doesn't love a fresh t-shirt?
