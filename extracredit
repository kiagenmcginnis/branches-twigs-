This class has flooded my mind with new and relevant topics revolving around technology. However, the biggest takeway 
for me a very important, yet somehow sorely lacking skill in many people which is to ask and keep asking. I loved that each
student was encouraged to Google with abandon any question, idea or thought they had. This is the first course Iâ€™ve had where 
students were able to communicate through a platform such as Slack and that will be a game-changer for me in future classes 
and potential workplaces. My favorite discussions about technology were those about women and other misrepresented groups in 
the field. The conversations we had inspired me to stick with technology because my voice as a female is critical. 
I was also left with the impression that the best way to approach technology is with a desire to succeed but an understanding 
and acceptance of failure. I learned more from this course than I have from basically any that provided a text book and written
tests.
