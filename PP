I signed a petition to let the United States Congress know that Planned Parenthood is an invaluable, neccessary institution for the safety and health of women in this country. I believe strongly that Planned Parenthood provides information and testing that many women would not receive elsewhere, and at little to no cost to them. It is a welcoming environment for women of all of ages and demographics to consult with medical professionals and receive proper care. I find it unacceptable that any person can buy a gun in the United States but women are denied basic rights to their own bodies. It is time for change.
